title: 167 - Two Sum II
tags: [easy, array]
---

Similar to the previous problem Two Sum, the only difference is that the original array is sorted in ascending order. The ways we used to solve the previous problem are also good for this one. 

We are going to use linear scan to solve this problem. Initially, we use **two pointers point to the front and tail** elements of the array. Considering the sum of the two numbers, if the sum is smaller than target, we move the left pointer one position to the right, making the sum bigger. Similarly, if the sum is bigger than target, we move the right pointer one position to the left, making the sum of two numbers smaller. By following this procedure, it is guaranteed we can find the solution if there is exactily one solution for the input array. The time complexity is **O(n)**.

```java
int left = 0, right = array.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    int sum = array[left] + array[right];
    if (sum == target) {    // found the solution
        return the solition; 
    }
    if (sum < target) {
        left += 1;  // move the left pointer 
    } else {
        right -= 1; // move the right pointer
    }
}
```

For the corner cases, the length of array might be zero or one. Numbers might be negative. For extending, we should considering what if elements might be duiplicated. What if there are more than one solutions.
